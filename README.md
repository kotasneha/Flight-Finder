The Flight Finder App is a full-stack web-based application designed to simplify the process of booking flight tickets.
It is developed using the MERN stack—MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.

This application enables users to search for flights, compare options, and complete bookings directly through a responsive interface.
The app is tailored for both frequent travelers and occasional users who want a quick and easy way to book flights.

Users can create accounts, log in securely, and manage their bookings through a personalized dashboard.
They can enter travel details such as departure, destination, travel dates, and preferred class to find available flights.

Search results are displayed with real-time details like price, airline, departure time, and flight duration.
The system allows users to apply filters to narrow down choices—for example, selecting direct flights or preferred airlines.

Once a flight is selected, the user can choose a seat using an interactive seat map and proceed to payment.
The app provides secure payment integration and generates a digital e-ticket and itinerary instantly.

Users also have the option to view, cancel, or modify bookings from their dashboard.
Behind the scenes, the app uses MongoDB to store user, flight, and booking information efficiently.

On the backend, Node.js and Express.js handle the API logic, routes, and server communication.
The frontend is built with React.js, providing a fast, dynamic, and responsive user experience.

An admin panel is included for managing the overall system.
Admins can add new flights, update schedules, monitor bookings, and manage user activity.

Admin login is separate and secure, ensuring that only authorized personnel can make backend changes.
All communication between client and server is handled through secure APIs using Axios.

The project follows a modular architecture, making it scalable and maintainable.
It includes proper error handling, authentication using bcrypt and JWT, and middleware for route protection.

Users benefit from a simple UI, real-time flight data, and seamless booking flow.
Developers can extend the app with additional features like notifications, loyalty programs, or travel history.

The ER diagram of the system models key entities like Users, Flights, Bookings, Payments, and Admins.
The application is well-documented and can be run locally using npm run dev.

All source code is version-controlled using Git and hosted on GitHub for collaboration.
Setup instructions include installation of Node.js, MongoDB, and React environment.

The Flight Finder App demonstrates how modern web technologies can deliver a real-world travel solution.
Its clean design, robust architecture, and end-to-end functionality make it an ideal final-year or portfolio project.
This project not only enhances user convenience but also shows how software can improve everyday life.
